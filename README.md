## About <a name = "about"></a>
Every morning I wake up 40 minutes earlier than when I have to actually wake up. I do this because I need to make sure there isn't traffic on my commute to work, which is painful because I have to enter my route into Google Maps. The idea for this app is to have a simple interface to refresh common routes, and have quick realtime traffic data display so that this process is simplified. Unfortunately there is no free API that provides end-to-end ETA's while taking traffic into consideration, so I'm currently trying to figure out a workaround. Stay tuned.
